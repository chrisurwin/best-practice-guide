## Failure Recovery
---

If a host enters reconnecting/disconnected state,attempt to re-run the agent registration command. Wait 3 minutes. If the host hasnâ€™t re-entered active state
1. Add a new host with similar resources and host labels 
2. Delete the old host from the environment. 
Containers will be scheduled to the new host and eventually become healthy.
